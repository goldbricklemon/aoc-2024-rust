## Usage

1. Whenever you're ready to start solving a new day's puzzle:
    - Open the `bin` folder, copy and paste the `NN.rs` file into it, and give it the corresponding name (`01.rs`, `02.rs`, etc.).
    - In the `input` folder, create and fill the input data file (`01.txt`, `02.txt`, etc.).
    - Fill in the `DAY` constant in the freshly created file.
    - Run the current day's solution to check if it compiles (you can use the gutter icon next to the `main` function).
    - Fill in `<TEST-INPUT>`.
    - Write the expected answer for the test data in the `assert_eq` statement in *Part 1*.
    - Now you're ready to write your solution in the `part1` function (inside `main`).
    - Use `Shift+F10` (Win/Linux) or `Ctrl-R` (macOS) to re-run the same program.

3. When you're done with the first part of the puzzle, use folding to hide *Part 1*.

4. Uncomment *Part 2*, fill in the test data assertion, and start solving it.
